# staticwebsync

staticwebsync is a command-line tool for automating the fiddly aspects of hosting your static web site on Amazon [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). It automates the process of configuring the services for hosting web sites, and synchronizes the contents of a local folder to the site.
